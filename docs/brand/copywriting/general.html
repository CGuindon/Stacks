    - As a working person today, you receive hundreds of messages a day. 99% of them are forgettable, and others contain important information you’ll need later. It’s time-consuming, tedious, and distracting to manage this influx of information. That’s where Stack Overflow comes in - it streamlines all of the important information you need – both public and private – to create an information hub. Use this hub to ask questions, hire technical talent, and do great work.
